### Commit SHA Rule Overview

This rule is designed to detect actions that are not using SHA-1 to specify the version.

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: "1.21.3"
      - name: Run GolangCI-Lint
        uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v2
        with:
          version: v1.49
          args: --timeout 5m
```

result

### Feature background
As the risk of supply chain attacks increases, ensuring the integrity of dependencies has become even more crucial. Since SHA values are immutable, they are more reliable than tags or branches, allowing you to securely lock in a specific version of an action. By using SHA-based versioning, you can minimize the risk of unintended updates or tampering, helping to protect against supply chain attacks.

In the past, one drawback of SHA-based versioning was the inability to automatically receive critical bug fixes or security updates for actions. To address this, tools like Renovate have emerged, and Dependabot has been enhanced to enable automated updates even when a version is pinned by SHA. This approach preserves the security of SHA-based versioning while ensuring updates to the latest secure versions, effectively balancing robust protection against supply chain attacks with the convenience of automated updates.
